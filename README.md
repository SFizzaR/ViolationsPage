# üöö Violations Page
Internship task (OPENPORT)

At Openport, pings are generated for violations of the following types:

1. Harsh Braking
2. Overspeeding
3. Multiple Violations
4. Nighttime Driving
5. Continuous Violations

This single-page application:

- Retrieves violation records from the database.
- Displays them in a paginated table with configurable records per page.
- Includes filters by violation type and date range.
- Includes a search function to search by vehicle number.
- Contains a functional navbar (currently minimal due to single-page scope).

## ‚ú® Features
- CRUD-safe retrieval of violations data.
- Pagination for efficient data handling.
- Filtering:
    1. By violation type.
    2. By date range.
- Search by vehicle number.
- Responsive table UI for quick reference and review.
- Functional navbar for future extensibility.
